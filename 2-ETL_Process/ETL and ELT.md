
## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- ETL and ELT are two common data integration methodologies. 
  ETL involves extracting raw data from various sources, transforming it to meet specific requirements,
  and then loading it into a target database.
## ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
- In contrast, ELT directly loads raw data into a data warehouse and performs data cleansing, enrichment, Tansformation
  within the warehouse itself.
  This approach allows for the indefinite storage of raw data, enabling multiple transformations and analyses over time.
## Why ETL Pipelines with Python?
- **Python is a popular choice for building ETL pipelines due to its:**

    - **Simplicity:** Python has a clear and readable syntax, making it easy to develop and maintain pipelines.

    - **Diversity:** There are numerous libraries such as ***Pandas***, ***NumPy***, ***SQLAlchemy***, and ***PySpark*** that are specifically 
      designed for data manipulation and analysis.

    - **Community:** Python has a large and active community that is constantly developing new tools and resources.        

### Steps to create an ETL pipeline:
- **Define data sources:**
    - Identify the sources of your data (e.g. databases, CSV files, APIs).
    - Connect to these sources (e.g. using SQLAlchemy for databases).
- **Extract data:**
    - ***Read*** the data from the sources (e.g. using Pandas for CSV files).
    - ***Filter*** the data as needed.
- **Transform data:**
    - ***Clean*** the data (e.g. removing duplicates, filling missing values).
    - ***Convert*** data types.
    - ***Aggregate*** data.
    - ***Perform*** calculations.
- **Load data:**
    - Write the transformed data to the target system (e.g. another database, a data warehouse).

## A very simple Pipeline
```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
#Extract data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

#Transform data
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df['amount'] = df['amount'].astype(float)

#Connecting to a PostgreSQL database
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/database')

#Load data into a table
df.to_sql('my_table', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

```
